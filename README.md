# Layer-Based Attack Simulations

This repository contains lab exercises that simulate various attacks across different layers of the OSI model. These labs focus on packet creation, vulnerability assessments, and defensive techniques, conducted using tools such as **Scapy**, **Nmap**, **Socket**, **Burpsuit**, and **Wireshark**. Each lab is designed to explore vulnerabilities and the corresponding countermeasures for each layer.
